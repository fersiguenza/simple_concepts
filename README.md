**Simple explanations for complex technical concepts**

SimpleConcepts is an open-source project aimed at providing clear, concise, and easy-to-understand explanations for complex technical topics. Each explanation is written in a short format with practical examples to help anyone grasp difficult concepts quickly.

## Our Mission

To make technology knowledge accessible to everyone by breaking down complex topics into simple, digestible explanations.

## Project Structure

- `_pages/`: Contains all main pages (home, about, browse, search)
- `_explanations/`: Contains all explanation files organized by category
- `_layouts/`: Contains HTML templates used for rendering content
- `assets/`: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and images
- `functions/`: Contains serverless functions for the Easy Contribution feature
- `_config.yml`: Main Jekyll configuration file

## How It Works

1. Each topic is explained in a single Markdown file
2. Explanations are kept short and to the point (typically under 300 words)
3. Examples are included to illustrate the concept in action
4. Community members can contribute their own explanations

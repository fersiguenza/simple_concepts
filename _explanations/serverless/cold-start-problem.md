## What is it?

A cold start occurs when a serverless function is invoked after being idle, causing latency as the cloud provider provisions resources before execution.

## Simple Explanation

Think of a cold start like starting your car in winter. A car that's been sitting needs time to warm up, while one that's already running starts instantly.

In serverless environments:
- Idle functions have their resources deallocated
- When invoked again, the system must:
  1. Provision a container
  2. Load the runtime
  3. Initialize code
  4. Execute the function

## Cold Start Visualization

```
Cold Start:
│                                │
│ Request ──► Container Setup ──► Code Init ──► Execution ──► Response
│            300-500ms or more                             │
│           ◄─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
│                     Total Latency                        │

Warm Start:
│                                                         │
│ Request ───────────────────► Execution ──► Response
│                                 ~10ms                   │
```

## Key Impact Factors

1. **Runtime**: Node.js/Python (faster) vs Java/.NET (slower)
2. **Package Size**: Smaller packages initialize faster
3. **Dependencies**: More dependencies = longer startup
4. **VPC Configuration**: VPC connectivity adds 1-10 seconds
5. **Memory Allocation**: More memory often means faster startup

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Keep Functions Warm

Use scheduled events to ping your function periodically:

```javascript
// AWS CloudWatch event rule (every 5 minutes)
const rule = new events.Rule(this, 'WarmupRule', {
  schedule: events.Schedule.rate(Duration.minutes(5))
});
rule.addTarget(new targets.LambdaFunction(myFunction));
```

### 2. Optimize Package Size

```bash
# Node.js example
npm install --production
npm prune --production
```

### 3. Use Pre-warmed Instances

Some providers offer provisioned concurrency:

```bash
# AWS Lambda example
aws lambda put-provisioned-concurrency-config \
  --function-name my-function \
  --qualifier prod \
  --provisioned-concurrent-executions 5
```

### 4. Code Optimization

- Move initialization code outside handler
- Lazy-load dependencies
- Implement connection pooling

## Real-World Impact

Cold starts create tangible problems:

- User frustration from inconsistent response times
- Hard-to-diagnose performance spikes
- Challenges in applications requiring consistent low latency
- Difficulty meeting strict SLAs

## Case Study: API Gateway + Lambda

A real API endpoint using Lambda behind API Gateway:
- First request after inactivity: 2-5 seconds
- Subsequent requests: 50-100ms
- After 15-30 minutes of inactivity: Back to cold start latency

## What is it?

Vibecoding is the practice of rapidly generating large amounts of code using AI assistants without proper planning or review, often leading to technical debt and structural problems.

## Simple Explanation

Imagine building a house by telling an AI:
1. "Make me a kitchen"
2. "Now add a bedroom"
3. "Add a bathroom next"

...without ever looking at a blueprint or considering how these pieces fit together.

You'll get a house quickly, but the plumbing might run through the bedroom, and the foundation might not support a second floor.

Vibecoding works the same way - you get code fast by asking an AI to generate pieces on demand, but without proper architecture, you create structural problems that become increasingly difficult to fix later.

## Key Problems

1. **Limited Context**: AI models can only "see" a portion of your code at once, missing the big picture
2. **Short-term vs. Long-term**: You gain speed now but pay with debugging time later
3. **Architecture Gaps**: AI excels at generating individual components but struggles with system-wide design
4. **Ownership Issues**: Developers may not fully understand code they didn't write themselves

## Better Approach

Use AI as a coding partner, not a replacement for planning:
- Start with architecture and design before generating code
- Review AI-generated code thoroughly
- Use AI for specific components rather than entire systems

## Best Practices

1. **Review Before Implementing**: Always scrutinize AI-generated code before integrating it

2. **Refactor Proactively**: When you spot duplicated functionality or complexity, refactor immediately

   ```javascript
   // Before: Duplicated logic in multiple places
   function validateUserEmail() { /* Similar validation logic */ }
   function validateAdminEmail() { /* Similar validation logic */ }
   
   // After: Refactored to remove duplication
   function validateEmail(email, role) { /* Unified validation logic */ }
   ```

3. **Maintain Security Vigilance**: AI might suggest insecure shortcuts

4. **Create Documentation**: Use AI to document what the code does and why

## Why it matters

The vibecoding approach can accelerate development dramatically but poses serious risks:
- Technical debt accumulates faster than ever before
- Maintenance becomes increasingly difficult
- Security vulnerabilities may go unnoticed
- Knowledge of how the system works becomes fragmented

Finding the right balance between speed and quality is crucial for sustainable development with AI tools.

## What is it?

Resilient systems architecture is a design approach that enables software applications to continue functioning despite unexpected events, recover gracefully from failures, and maintain availability even when components fail.

## Simple Explanation

Think of resilience like the ability of a car to continue driving after hitting a pothole. A non-resilient car might break down entirely, while a resilient one might wobble but keep going.

In software, resilience means your system can:
- Continue working when a component fails
- Recover automatically from most errors
- Degrade gracefully when resources are limited
- Scale up and down as needed

## Core Principles

1. **Redundancy**: Having backup components ready to take over (like spare tires)
2. **Isolation**: Preventing failures from cascading to other parts of the system
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Stopping requests to failing services to allow them to recover
4. **Monitoring**: Detecting problems quickly to enable faster responses
5. **Self-healing**: Automating recovery processes without human intervention

## Disaster Recovery Strategies

- **Backup and Restore**: Regular data backups with tested restoration procedures
- **Pilot Light**: Core systems kept running with minimal resources
- **Warm Standby**: Secondary environment ready to scale up quickly
- **Hot Site**: Fully redundant system running continuously

### Resilience Patterns

1. **Circuit Breaker**: Stops calling a failing service until it recovers
   ```
   if (service.hasFailedTooManyTimes()) {
     return fallbackResponse();
   }
   ```

2. **Retry Pattern**: Attempts an operation again after failure
   ```
   for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= 3; attempt++) {
     try {
       return callService();
     } catch (Exception e) {
       wait(attempt * 100); // Exponential backoff
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Bulkhead**: Isolates components so one failure doesn't sink everything
   ```
   // Each service gets its own thread pool
   executor.submit(task, getPoolFor(serviceName));
   ```

## Why it matters

In today's interconnected systems, failures aren't a matter of if, but when. Resilient systems:
- Provide better user experiences with fewer outages
- Save money by avoiding catastrophic failures
- Allow for faster innovation by reducing fear of change
- Enable teams to sleep at night instead of fixing emergencies

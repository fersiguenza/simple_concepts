## What is it?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs your code in response to events without requiring you to manage servers.

## Simple Explanation

Think of Lambda as a light switch. You don't need to keep the electricity running all the time - you just flip the switch when you need light. Similarly, Lambda functions only run when triggered by an event (like an HTTP request, a file upload, or a database change).

When inactive, you pay nothing. When active, you pay only for the compute time used. This makes Lambda ideal for variable workloads, automation tasks, and backend services that don't need to run constantly.

Lambda handles all the infrastructure, automatically scaling from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You just upload your code and define when it should run.

## Example

```javascript
// A simple Lambda function in Node.js
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    // Log the incoming event
    console.log('Event received:', JSON.stringify(event));
    
    // Process the event
    const message = `Hello, ${event.name || 'World'}!`;
    
    // Return a response
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: message
    };
};
```

## Why it matters

Lambda is a cornerstone of serverless architecture, enabling developers to build applications without managing servers. This results in:
- Lower operational costs (pay only for what you use)
- Automatic scaling
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Faster development cycles

## Tips for optimization

1. **Initialize outside the handler**: Move variable initializations outside the function handler to benefit from container reuse.
2. **Keep packages small**: Use techniques like tree shaking to reduce dependency size.
3. **Use Lambda layers**: Share common dependencies across functions.

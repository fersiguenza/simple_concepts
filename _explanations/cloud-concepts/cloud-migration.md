## What is it?

Cloud migration is the process of moving digital assets — like data, applications, or entire IT infrastructure — from on-premise servers to cloud environments provided by companies like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Simple Explanation

Think of cloud migration like moving from your own house (where you maintain everything) to a managed apartment building (where services are provided).

In your house (on-premise):
- You buy all the appliances and furniture (servers and hardware)
- You pay for electricity and maintenance even when not using rooms (idle servers)
- You're responsible for security and repairs (IT maintenance and security)

In the apartment building (cloud):
- The building provides services and infrastructure (cloud provider)
- You only pay for what you use (pay-as-you-go model)
- Basic maintenance and security are handled for you (managed services)

## Migration Strategies (The 6 R's)

1. **Rehost** ("lift and shift"): Move applications without changes
2. **Replatform** ("lift, tinker and shift"): Make some optimizations but keep the core architecture
3. **Repurchase** ("drop and shop"): Switch to a different product, often SaaS
4. **Refactor/Re-architect**: Redesign applications to be cloud-native
5. **Retire**: Remove applications that are no longer needed
6. **Retain**: Keep certain applications on-premise for now

## Key Benefits

- **Cost savings**: Pay only for what you use instead of maintaining idle capacity
- **Scalability**: Easily expand resources as needed
- **Flexibility**: Access to a wide range of services and tools
- **Disaster recovery**: Built-in redundancy and backup capabilities

- **Application migration**: Moving entire applications
  ```
  Options include:
  - Rehost (lift-and-shift)
  - Replatform (lift-and-optimize)
  - Refactor (rebuild for cloud)
  ```

### 2. Data Compliance

Different regions have different regulations:

```
EU Data: Must typically remain in EU regions
PII: May require special handling
Healthcare Data: Often requires compliance with HIPAA
```

Make sure to consult your legal team before choosing server locations.

### 3. Infrastructure as Code

Always use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for cloud resources:

```terraform
# Terraform example
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- Reproducible environments
- Version control for infrastructure
- Automated deployment
- Disaster recovery

## Why it matters

Cloud migration offers significant advantages:
- Cost reduction (pay-per-use vs. always-on)
- Scalability (grow or shrink as needed)
- Improved reliability and availability
- Access to advanced services (AI, machine learning, etc.)
- Reduced maintenance burden

However, without proper planning, migrations can disrupt business operations, increase costs, or create security vulnerabilities.
